# FEConfigurator
A simple GUI application to propely configurate Fable Explorer.
**Only the ShadowNet build of Fable Explorer supports these kind of configurations!**

## Usage
Download the latest zip file from Releases.
From the zip file, put FEConfigurator.exe into Fable Explorer's folder. (Where the FableExplorer.exe file is)
Launch FEConfigurator.exe

## Features
You can change the following settings of Fable Explorer:

 - Load Fable game files path from Windows Registry
	 - Using this may cause Fable Explorer crashing with NullReferenceException upon startup if you are using the Steam release, or 64 bit version of Windows Vista or later versions of the OS.
- Load Fable game files from manually set path
- Specify Fable game files location
- Enable or disable custom splash image when starting up Fable Explorer
- Change the custom splash image
- Creates def.xml file automatically, if needed
- Creates default config.xml file automatically, if needed


## Dependencies	
This software was made with Visual Basic Express 2008.
Thus, you need .NET Framework 3.5 or later to run. (It's very likely you have it already)


## Notes
I really like Fable, but not at a "fangirlish" state. I wanted to play the game on my native language, and I needed Fable Explorer for that.
Now, finding a working copy of Fable Explorer out of the box is no easy task nowadays and it has to be configured just right to run.
This is why I made this project, to preserve the usability of FE for a long time now.
